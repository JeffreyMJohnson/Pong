Pong Dong
A ‘Pong Clone’ made by Jeffrey M. Johnson.
The game is based on the rules for ping-pong. 2 players take turns returning a ball to the other side of the table.  If ball moves past a player’s paddle and off the edge of the screen the other player gains a point.  To win the match a player must gain more than 10 points and be ahead of his/her opponent by at least 2 points.
The player on the left-hand side of the screen is controlled by the ‘W’ and ‘X’ keys, while the player on the right uses the ‘[‘ and ‘/’ keys.
